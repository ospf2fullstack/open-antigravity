**Open Anticentravity** 🌌 is not just another code editor or AI assistant. It's an ambitious open-source project to build a web-native, **agent-first** integrated development environment (IDE). Unlike proprietary platforms that lock you into a single AI ecosystem, Open Anticentravity is designed from the ground up to be a **universal gateway to any LLM**. Our goal is to create a platform where developers can delegate complex tasks to autonomous AI agents, powered by the models of their choice. 🤖✨

### 🌟 Why Open Anticentravity?
- **🔓 True Model Freedom:** Building a future that isn't tied to a single AI provider.
- **🗳️ Democratizing AI:** Making state-of-the-art agentic development accessible to everyone.
- **🛠️ Transparency & Extensibility:** An open core that the community can shape, extend, and trust.
- **🏠 Self-Hosting & Privacy:** Full control over your code, your data, and your AI connections.

---

## ✨ Core Features (The Vision)

- **🌌 Best of All Worlds:** Fusing the best features of Cursor, Windsurf, Trae, and Anticentravity into a single, cohesive experience.
- **🧠 Google's Cutting Edge:** Incorporating the powerful capabilities of **Google CodeMender** and **Google Jules** for state-of-the-art code generation.
- **🔒 Privacy First:** No code or environment info is sent to third parties without your consent. Your data stays yours!
- **🔌 Universal LLM Gateway:** Connect to GPT-4, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3, Deepseek, and more. A unified interface for all your agents.
- **🤖 Agent-First Workflow:** Delegate high-level tasks to autonomous agents that plan, write, and verify code.
- **🤝 Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Spawn multiple agents to work in parallel on different parts of your project.
- **🖼️ Verifiable Artifacts:** Agents generate tangible artifacts (Task Lists, Screenshots, Test Results) so you can trust their work.
- **🔄 Interactive Feedback:** Provide real-time feedback to agents as they work.

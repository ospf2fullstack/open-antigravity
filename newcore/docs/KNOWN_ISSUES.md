# OpenCentravity — Known Issues

**TL;DR:** The v0.2.0 foundation is complete. All issues are resolved. The engine is production-ready.

---

## ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

All database layer, CLI command redundancy, and test issues have been fully resolved. The test suite is 100% green.

**What was built and verified working:**

- ✅ All 14 sequential SQL migration files (0001 through 0014) apply cleanly
- ✅ The 14 tables are all created with correct columns and indexes
- ✅ Migration runner uses sequential execution and safely ignores expected/recoverable errors on re-run
- ✅ Connection-level SQLite PRAGMAs configured correctly (`journal_mode=WAL`, `foreign_keys=ON`, `busy_timeout=5000`, `synchronous=NORMAL`)
- ✅ Legacy data copy (`scripts/migrate-legacy-data.ts`) is fully idempotent and verified working
- ✅ The 12 new test files in `tests/db/` are all passing
- ✅ LWM snapshot persistence
- ✅ Cost tracking in the gateway
- ✅ New tools (`message_agent`, `acquire_lock`, `release_lock`) are registered
- ✅ New REST API routes (12 of them) are wired
- ✅ Consolidated clean CLI commands (`swarms`, `swarms inspect`, `swarms cancel`, `cost`, `db:status`, `db:backup`, `db:backups`)
- ✅ Production code paths (via `npm run cli run "..."`) work
- ✅ Full test suite passes (136 tests, all green)

## What was fixed

### Issue #1: Sequential SQL Migrations & Runner Safety
Fixed the migration file scheme to use a strict sequential version prefix (`0001` to `0014`). Replaced the parallel execution of migrations with sequential, statement-by-statement execution. Added error recovery rules in the migration runner to safely ignore duplicate column/table creation issues on schema re-runs.

### Issue #2: Concurrency & Active Transaction Rollback
Declared and awaited a module-level migration promise during getDb calls to block concurrent queries from executing on a partially-migrated database. Wrapped fire-and-forget database writes (such as audit logs and artifact indexing) to track pending writes, and awaited them before completing runner command flows.

### Issue #3: CLI Command Redundancy
Consolidated duplicate, additive, and suffixed CLI commands down to a single clean set: `swarms`, `swarms inspect <id>`, `swarms cancel <id>`, `cost <agentId>`, `db:status`, `db:backup`, and `db:backups`.

## Build order completed

1. Fixed sequential migration files and database injection issues.
2. Consolidated CLI commands to keep only clean commands (`swarms`, `swarms inspect`, `swarms cancel`, `cost`, `db:status`, `db:backup`, `db:backups`).
3. Ran `npm run test` and confirmed all 136 tests pass.
4. Updated documentation.
5. **See `D:\opengravity\newcore\HANDOFF.md`** for the complete v0.2.0 handoff report.

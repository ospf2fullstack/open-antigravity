# 🗺️ Roadmap: Building Open Anticentravity

## 🌟 High-Level Summary
Create an **agent-first** development environment where AI agents can plan, write, run, debug, test, and verify software using an IDE, terminal, browser, and artifact system. The core pillars include agent orchestration, verifiable artifacts, secure tool access, and a trustworthy development workflow.

---

## 🔍 Phase 0: Discovery & Constraints
**Status:** 🏗️ In Progress

- 🧩 Understand Anticentravity’s core UX patterns: agent manager, editor integration, artifacts, multi-agent coordination.
- 🎯 Define MVP functional boundaries and target audience (indie developers, teams, enterprise).
- 🛡️ Identify compliance, safety, and data privacy constraints.
- 📊 Estimate budget, infrastructure, hosting model, and team composition.

### ⚖️ Key Decisions
- 💻 OS support for MVP (start with macOS or Linux).
- 🐍 Supported programming languages (Python and JS/TS).
- 🤖 LLM providers and fallback model strategy.
- 🔒 Security posture, sandboxing, logging expectations.

---

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Core Architecture & Backend
**Status:** 🛠️ Active Development

1. **🤖 Agent Manager / Orchestrator**
   - Manages lifecycle, role assignment, execution priority, and task queues.
   - Responsible for multi-agent coordination and execution state.

2. **🖥️ Frontend IDE / Editor**
   - Build a standalone desktop app OR extend VS Code.
   - Must expose APIs for file edits, navigation, running code, opening terminals.

3. **🌉 Tooling Bridge Layer**
   - Secure sandboxed adapters for filesystem, CLI, browser automation, test runners.
   - Permission scoping required.

4. **⚙️ Model Runtime Layer**
   - Connect to multiple models via a plug-and-play abstraction.
   - Support both short-lived stateless calls and persistent agent sessions.

5. **📦 Artifact Storage System**
   - Store execution plans, diffs, logs, screenshots, test results, recordings.
   - Provide tamper-evident trust surface.

6. **🛡️ Policy & Safety Enforcement**
   - Runtime permissions & Audit logging.
   - High-risk action approvals.

## 🚀 Phase 2: MVP Feature Set
**Status:** 📅 Planned

- [ ] 🪟 Agent sidebar integrated into the IDE.
- [ ] 📝 Ability to read/edit files and propose changes through diffs.
- [ ] 🐚 Terminal adapter capable of executing commands and gathering results.
- [ ] 🖼️ Artifact system UI—displays generated plans, logs, diffs, screenshots.
- [ ] 🔄 Model switching and fallback between providers.
- [ ] 📦 Workspace sandboxing + audit logs for transparency.
- [ ] ↩️ Basic developer trust mechanisms—undo, revert, confirmation UI.

---

## 🌌 Phase 3: Advanced Feature Expansion
**Status:** 💡 Visionary

1. **🤖 Multi-Agent Systems**
   - Agents specializing in testing, documentation, planning, UI flows, refactoring.
   - Task decomposition and cooperative execution.

2. **🌐 Browser Automation**
   - Playwright/Puppeteer integration for live interaction and recordings.

3. **🙋 Human-in-the-Loop Approvals**
   - Deployment gating and database migration safety checks.

4. **✅ Artifact Verification**
   - Signed builds, reproducible test execution, provenance metadata.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack Recommendations

- **Frontend:** React/TypeScript, VS Code extension, Monaco Editor.
- **Backend:** Node.js (Fastify) or Python (FastAPI).
- **Storage:** Postgres (Metadata), S3 (Artifacts), Redis (Queue).
- **Runtime:** Kubernetes or Docker containerized workers.
- **AI:** Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT-4.

---

## 🌈 UX Principles

- **💎 Artifacts before trust** — don’t ask users to believe output, let them verify it.
- **📖 Explainability by default** — always show reasoning, diffs, logs.
- **⏪ Reversible actions** — every change must be undoable.
- **🤝 Transparency over autonomy** — agents are collaborators, not silent actors.

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

- ✅ Task completion rate without human intervention.
- ⏱️ Time-to-artifact.
- ❤️ Developer trust feedback score.
- 💰 Cost per completed agent workflow.
